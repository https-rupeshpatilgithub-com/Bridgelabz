Purpose:Sum of three Integer adds to ZERO
 A program with cubic running time. Read in N integers and counts the
number of triples that sum to exactly 0.
I/P -> N number of integer, and N integer input array
Logic -> Find distinct triples (i, j, k) such that a[i] + a[j] + a[k] = 0
O/P -> One Output is number of distinct triplets as well as the second output is to
print the distinct triplets.
